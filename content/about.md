I’m a full-stack software developer at Double Eleven, working in the Systems Development team. We build internal tools that help teams across the studio work more efficiently throughout the game development process.

I previously studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London, where I gradually pivoted towards software and realised that building things with code was what I enjoyed most.

Outside of work (you can learn more about my work experiences [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leeszetyng/)), I’m a big fan of contemporary musicals. I spent a lot of time exploring London’s theatre scene while I was at university, and I still jump at the chance to watch a show whenever I can.

I also enjoy weight training and running, and today’s fitness tech scene somehow lets me combine my passion for data visualisation with my goal of improving my personal health.

My other interests include coffee, reading and listening to way too much music while having no musical talent whatsoever.

If you’d like to get in touch or take a look at my CV, you can reach me at [lee.szetyng@gmail.com](mailto:lee.szetyng@gmail.com) or any of my socials linked above!
