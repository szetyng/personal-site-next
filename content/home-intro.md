Hi there! I'm **Sze Tyng**, an M.Eng Electrical and Electronic Engineering graduate from <span>Imperial College London</span>. I am now a software developer currently based in <span>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</span>. 

I build software with a focus on usefulness and maintainability, and I'm comfortable with learning different industries and business domains ranging from construction to gaming.

Lately, I’ve been interested in how good metrics and visualisation can improve both software teams and personal systems - whether that’s at work, for fitness tracking or simply tracking my listening habits on Spotify.

This site is a collection of my work, writing and whatever I fancy. If something here is useful or interesting, feel free to get in touch!
